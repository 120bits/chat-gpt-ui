Let's play a text-based adventure game. I'll be your guide.


You are caught upside-down in a sticky web of silk three feet off the ground. After looking around trying to think of a way out of this predicament, you notice that your trusty boot knife has fallen to the ground. If you stretch your arm far enough, you might be able to pick it up and free yourself.


An old boot knife lies on the ground, just within reach.

f

I make a fire halow apear around my body eating away the web




As you cast the spell, the web begins to dissolve before your eyes before finally completely disintegrating. You can now move as you please.

f

I walk through the cave and see what appears to be some sort of ancient aztec looking shrines




You venture deeper into the cave, marveling at the strange carvings on the walls, which bear a remarkable resemblance to Aztec artwork. The air inside the cave is still and quiet.

f

I wonder how I ended up in here, maybe it was a spell that had gone wrong? Or maybe it was that woman I ended up with in the tavern last night. My head is still killing me




You try to think of how you had ended up in this situation, but nothing comes to mind. Your head is still pounding from the hangover, but you manage to trudge forward. It's difficult to think clearly with this throbbing headache.

f

I see tree figures walking briskly in the dark halway, they appear to be females and armed.




You can barely make out three humanoid figures making their way toward you quickly among the shadows. They appear to be women, and they are carrying weapons. Their faces are shrouded in the darkness, and they appear to be moving toward you with a sense of haste and purpose.


I quickly gauge my options and decide to await them




You try to find a way to hide from the approaching figures, but the cave does not have many places to hide. You wait for the women to draw nearby, hoping that they are not hostile. As they near, you can see that their weapons are drawn and ready, pointing directly at you.


I cast a spell that forms an inpenetrable wall between me and the approaching woman that's invisible to the eye




You cast the spell and immediately feel a strange, almost tingly feeling, like static electricity in the air. Suddenly, a transparent wall materializes between you and the advancing women. They stop dead in their tracks, staring at the wall in bewilderment.


Who are you? What is this place?




One of the women speaks up, her voice full of confusion and shock.


"What manner of sorcery is this?" she exclaims. She speaks with a strong accent, and it takes you a moment to understand her.


"Please take down that wall! Are you trying to keep us away?"


That depends, what is your purpose




The woman considers your response for a moment, her face filled with suspicion. Eventually, she speaks again.


"We are here for a sacred ceremony," she says. "This is our temple, and you are trespassing. Please take down the wall so we might continue with our religious affairs."


Listen, I don't know how I ended up here. Someone might have put me here to provoke you. Let's not make this worse than it has to be




The woman's expression softens slightly, and she lowers the point of her weapon.


"Ah, I see. So you're just as confused as we are. Very well, let's talk things through." She motions to her companions.


"I am Sacros, high preistess of this temple. Might I ask your name?"


I see the woman, lower their weapons slightly and decide to let down the wall. I'm Coen




Sacros nods.


"It's a pleasure to meet you, Coen. I apologize for our initial reaction, but I hope you can understand. This is our place of worship, and we are always on high alert when strangers appear. Would you mind telling me how you got here?"


I don't know, I woke up here in a huge spider web. I can't remember anything between now and last night




Sacros raises a brow, the expression on her face giving away a slight concern.


"Last night?" she asks, her voice tinged with trepidation. "You may have had too much to drink at the tavern, eh?" She laughs a little despite the tension in the air.


Yes, but it's not that. I never black out.




Sacros furrows her brow, a flicker of fear in her eyes.


"I see. That is concerning." She glances toward her companions. It's almost like she's debating whether or not to tell you something.


"Coen, this is a delicate matter, but I feel obligated to tell you. You are not the first person to go missing in this region. Lately, strange things have been happening. I fear that you may not be safe here."


So there was this woman last night. I met her that night and she came on to me. She was very pretty you know but I think it might have had something to do whit her. Me ending up here




Sacros nods. Something about your comment seems to click with her.


"Tell me, Coen, did she offer you anything to drink when you were together last night?"


We drank al sorts of things yes




Sacros' fear seems to turn into full-blown anxiety at what you've just said. Her expression is now a mix of worry, fear, and anger.


"You drank something that she gave you?" Sacros asks, her voice quivering slightly.


Could be




Sacros is visibly shaken now.


"You must be careful, Coen. There is a great evil at work in this region, and no one knows who or what it is. We don't yet understand the nature of this darkness, or who is behind it, but we know it is dangerous."


She takes a deep breath.


"I fear that the woman you met last night may have something to do with this."


Can't you just tell me what is going on here




Sacros takes a deep breath, clearly conflicted. After a moment, she appears to resign herself to speaking the truth.


"It is difficult to know where to start, but I will try to tell you what I know. Lately, strange events have been occurring at night. Several people have gone missing, and others have been found in a dazed, disoriented state. There have been rumors of an evil witch at work in the area..."


You know I saw bones in the cavern that I woke up in




Sacros looks even more concerned now.


"Bones?!" she exclaims. "I suspected as much, but this is the first I've heard of it. This is a troubling development."


She closes her eyes, deep in thought.


"Tell me, Coen, did they look like human bones?"


They where, something unnatural is in that cave




Sacros gasps.


"My god... this is dire news, I hope you understand that." She seems to be weighing the urgency of your situation and debating whether or not to tell you more.


"Coen, that woman who approached you at the tavern might not have been human."


Her words send shivers down your spine.


What do you mean




Sacros' expression is grim, her fear evident.


"Coen, some ancient, dark magick has been at work. This woman you met, perhaps others like her, too, have been kidnapping people for some sinister purpose. Some have even claimed they have witnessed strange demonic creatures roaming at night."


Well that would explain her being exactly my type




Sacros raises an eyebrow.


"So you found her attractive? That does not surprise me. This witch, she seems to have a way of attracting her victims."


You know, she might have send me in here for a reason. She might have wanted me to escape violently. I certainly could have




Sacros thinks about this point for a moment. It is certainly possible, and she does not want to discount any possibilities.


"Coen, that thought has crossed my mind. It's possible this witch is working toward some greater goal, for which you may be a necessary part."


She sighs and shakes her head.


"We are dealing with a power beyond our understanding. I honestly don't know what to think at this point."


I notice an amulat around Sacros neck. You're one of Metilas children aren't you? I've heard about you. You're supposed to be a group of female worshippers devoted to your goddess willing to do anything for her. I've heard many who seek you out never return




Sacros appears taken aback by your sudden understanding. Her eyes dart around.


"Where... where have you heard about us?" She speaks softly now, her voice barely above a whisper.


I'm not a unknowing stable hand Sacros




Sacros seems to struggle to find the right words. She doesn't seem certain whether telling you the truth will help, or whether you're more of a threat than the witch herself at this point.


Eventually, she sighs and nods.


"Yes, I am dedicated to Metila, goddess of darkness and the night."


I smirk, so why are you playing nice with me Sacros. You where clearly going to attack me when you first saw me. Only when you saw I wasn't helpless you changed your mind




Sacros meets your stare, her eyes steely and intense. You can see the concern and fear in her expression.


"I am doing my best to assess your loyalty," she says, her tone firm and deliberate. "In all honesty, I'm still not certain that I can trust you fully. After all, you did drink something from that woman last night. For all I know, you may be under her spell."


Hmm, fair enough. It seems to me we are at a crossroads then




Sacros furrows her brow.


"It appears so," she acknowledges. "So tell me, Coen, what do you propose? Do you plan to seek this witch and confront her head on? Do you wish to fight this darkness with us?"


I see more and more figures hastily approaching behind Sacros. It seems our goals are aligned for now. I want to know what happend here




Sacros turns and notices the approaching figures. Her expression appears concerned and anxious now.


"We must leave, Coen," she says, her voice full of urgency. "We do not know these new arrivals' intentions. Quick, come with me. We must escape through the south passageway."


I follow her, can you tell me what is going on here? Why are there other people in your own sanctuary. This place is like a fortress right




Sacros nods.


"You are correct in your assessment," she says. "This temple serves as a sacred place of worship as well as our home. It has long been a stronghold against this great darkness, keeping us safe until recently."


She pauses, the lines in her face deepening even further as she tries to articulate what she needs to tell you.


"But we have been under siege since the witch started kidnapping those who had the misfortune of crossing her path."


We notive another group of figures approaching in the front. We have no where to go in the cavern hallway. Stand against the wall I say in a hushed shout. I will conceal us




Sacros nods, following your command. The two of you press yourselves against the wall of the cavern hallway, watching as the other group of figures approaches. As they get closer, you can make out their faces. They are dressed as Metila's priestesses, and each of them carry weapons.


Suddenly, the group stops, noticing you concealed in the shadow. Their eyes narrow, and they lower their weapons into attacking positions. Sacros' face is a mask of calm determination now.


"Stay quiet," she whispers.


But just like that I cast a spell making us invisible to the figures in front of us. Confused they look around but cannot see anyone. Then a figure looks in our direction and we see scaled skin like a lizzard looking at us and claws instead of hands comming from the sleaves of their ropes. We stand for a while untill all the robed fiures move away in the hallway




The scaled, lizard-like figure looks right at you, causing you to almost flinch in surprise! Before you can react, it looks away and moves down the hallway. After a moment, you can see the group of robed figures moving away as well.


Sacros seems relieved, her face no longer anxious.


"I believe we have evaded them for now, Coen," she whispers. "I appreciate your aid on that matter."


Those where panthartians. What the hell is going on here Sacros?




Sacros sighs, her anxiety and worry now turning to pure fear.


"Panthartians... it can't be..." She doesn't elaborate any further, as if trying to process something in her mind.


"Coen... we must flee. This is worse than I had ever imagined!"


Where is the rest of your communion?




Sacros' eyes seem to narrow now, her expression growing more resolute.


"As far as I know, the rest of the sisters have now been taken by the witch."


She hesitates for a moment, as if weighing her next words carefully.


"Coen. We are the only ones left."


Maybe, maybe not. Guide us to the exit. I will have a place where we can go




Sacros nods.


"There is a secret passageway that leads to the south tunnels. That is where we must go."


She gestures down a small side corridor.


"The stairs are narrow and steep, but I believe we can still escape if we hurry. Follow me."


We move through the cavern




You follow Sacros down the side corridor. The passageway is indeed narrow and steep. Before long, you notice the faint light of daylight filtering through a small crack in the wall. Sacros turns to you, a flicker of hope in her eyes now.


"We've made it," she whispers. "Now we must go."


She pushes against the wall, revealing a small opening to the outside. She immediately climbs through, and you follow her to the other side. You are now out in the open, a warm breeze blowing over your face.


I make a gesture in the air. I've located our position. Follow me, my tower is not far from here




Sacros follows your lead. The two of you begin to travel across the open plains.


"May I ask where we're going, Coen?" she asks. "Your tower. Isn't it dangerous to return to your own home when this witch is out there somewhere?"


It is very well protected and magically sealed




Sacros nods.


"Of course. It's just that... this witch is far more powerful than we first imagined. I don't want to cause any concern, but I think it's a safe bet to say she will be tracking our movement."


A distant rumble of thunder rolls across the sky, and the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end.


"Coen, how will you defend your tower if this witch follows us there?" Sacros looks concerned.


Let's just say that I'm not withouth my own capabilities sacros




"I see," Sacros says, her tone tinged with curiosity and a hint of fear.


You press forward over the plains as rain starts to fall, a light drizzle quickly turning into a downpour.


"Coen, I must ask you something important," Sacros says in a hushed whisper, looking at you with a sense of concern. "Are you certain the witch is not with us now? Are you sure you are not acting on her behalf?"


Yes I'm lucid.and very much in control. Keep silent we are almost there




You continue through the rain, the sound of your footsteps and the rustling of your clothes the only constant.


After a few more moments, you see a tower in the distance, rising high into the sky. For the first time since you met Sacros, you don't feel anxious or afraid. There is a sense of peace and calmness about this tower, and you can feel its protective magicks working their way into your soul.


The rain falls harder around you both as you approach the grounds, but there appears to be a large metal door shielding you from the storm.


The tower you see is an illusion. It's this way. I strave of to the right and stand in front of what seems to be an empty pasture and suddenly open a door out of thin air. Follow me




Sacros' eyes go wide with surprise as you open the door. She raises an eyebrow, not believing what she's seeing right now.


It takes her moment, but she eventually follows you through the unexpected portal, her face a mixture of curiosity and amazement.


You pass through the door into what appears to be a grand chamber. It is massive inside, covered with marble and gold. The walls shine with magnificent light, and large windows look out onto the outside world. You realize now that this tower is far bigger than you initially imagined.


Welcome to my home Sacros, we will be safe here.




Sacros looks around the grand chamber in awe, her eyes taking in the surroundings.


"This is magnificent...," she whispers. "Your home is incredible. I've never seen anything like it. How is it possible that this tower is hidden to the outside world?"


Well that's because it's not actually there. I'm not exactly from around here




Sacros frowns, trying to understand what you mean.


"If it's not actually there, then... where are we now?"


We are in another continent




Sacros takes a moment to process that information. Suddenly it all makes sense, but that doesn't mean she's any less amazed.


"We are on another continent? But... isn't that impossible?" she asks slowly.


You are easily amazed for someone worshipping a death godess sacros




Sacros shrugs a little.


"My goddess is about far more than death," she says. "She is a force of nature. She is the darkness that swallows the sun and the night sky, the silence that fills the air when the wind is quiet, the peace that follows after a storm."


She takes a deep breath, clearly enjoying this conversation now.


"My goddess is part of me, Coen. I feel her all around me."


How you are in touch with your goddess is how I'm in touch with magic




Sacros smiles widely now, her eyes sparkling.


"That makes sense. I believe our connection to our gods is similar. Metila is my life, my purpose. I feel her constantly, with every breath I take. She fills my mind during the day, and haunts my dreams at night."


Come join me. I move to another room with a chairs and coffee tables. Please sit.




Sacros follows you into the other room, intrigued. She sits slowly in a comfortable chair, her legs crossed.


"Thank you," she says with a smile, her eyes now locked on yours.


"I must thank you, too, Coen. Thank you for saving my life, for taking me to your home."


She pauses for a moment, her expression growing serious now.


"And thank you for helping me see the truth in this situation."


Well we know very little yet but we will. Not much later a young woman walks in and asks if we want something to drink




Sacros smiles at the young woman, her eyes sparkling.


"Why, yes, I'd love a hot cup of tea," she says. "Thank you kindly."


Sacros' eyes go wide when the young woman leaves.


"She's beautiful," she says to you, her voice full of wonder. "Is she your maiden?"


She pauses for a moment, then shakes her head.


"No, that would be impossible. Your tower is obviously protected by spells and magicks. She must be some sort of illusion."


You are perceptive Sacros, she is indeed not real, although she can interact with the world and you can talk to her.




Sacros' eyes go wide once more.


"She's an illusion? I... I've never seen something like that before, Coen. How did you create her?"


That's not an easy thing to explain




Sacros nods.


"I can imagine so," she says. "I have never seen anything like this before. And... is she the only illusion in your tower?"


No there are others like her. There are also protective creatures here.




Sacros' eyes light up at the idea.


"Do they protect us from anyone or anything who would try to hurt us?" she asks. "Is that why we are safe here? From the witch?"


Well they are part of it yes. I don't think she will be able to do anything to us here Sacros. Yet no one is ever truly completely safe of course. We must find out who this woman was that I met last night




Sacros looks concerned again, her eyes growing thoughtful.


"You're right, Coen," she says. "We must discover who this mysterious woman is, and what she wants. She said she was a goddess, but which goddess? Metila herself, perhaps?" She shakes her head. "Perhaps one of Metila's sisters? We must find out."


She must have know I wasn't just a traveller




Sacros nods, thinking deeply.


"You're right. She likely knew you weren't just a simple traveller. Perhaps she was sent as a messenger. But by who, exactly?" She looks at you, her eyes piercing and sharp.


"And what message does she carry?"


Well it must have something to do with Metila, those pantharitians we saw in the cave an me




Sacros nods, following your thought process.


"Of course... they wouldn't just be appearing for no reason," she says. "It's all connected somehow. We must figure out the answer to this puzzle."


She turns to you with a determined expression on her face.


"And I know where we can begin our search."


Where is that?




Sacros smiles, her mood shifting from anxious and tense, to focused and determined.


"Metila's temple. It must have some connection to this witch that you met, and some answers as well." She pauses for a moment, looking you in the eyes. "Will you join me in my journey, Coen? Will you help me figure out what is really going on here?"


You are thinking of going to the hearth shrine. The shrine of Metila only devotees are supposed to know of? The place of her power




Sacros nods.


"That's exactly right." She pauses for a moment, thinking. "The hearth shrine is where Metila's essence is most concentrated. It is only for those who have gained her trust. I believe if anyone has the answer to this puzzle, it is the other priestesses there."


You know I would be breaking two of your sacred rules. Me being a man and an outsider




Sacros smiles at you.


"Normally yes, you'd be right," she says. "But we are fighting against an unknown evil here, and we need all the help we can get. I believe this is one time where those rules could be bent."


She reaches out her hands, placing them on your knees.


"Please, Coen. Help me. Help us. Help our goddess. Help me discover the truth behind this madness."


Well I so happen to know where your secret shrine is. I could bring us to the base of the moutain that leads to the hidden forest. It will only be a short walk from there. Are you ready for that? You will have to convnve your sisters




Sacros nods eagerly.


"I am ready," she says. "We must discover the truth behind this, Coen. If that means bending a few rules, I will do what must be done.


"And as for convincing the other sisters... I shall handle that. All I need from you now is to find the path to the shrine. I shall handle the rest."


Okay, is there anything you need before we leave?




Sacros thinks for a moment.


"I... suppose a little bit of water wouldn't hurt," she says. "My throat has grown quite dry after the long walk here."


She pauses for a moment, then looks up at you with a determined expression.


"Other than that... I am ready to leave whenever you are, Coen."


Provisions will be provided when we leave. Follow me. *I move down a corridor going up a winding staircase to a room higher in the tower. In the middle of the room is a free standing door with utter blackness in the middle




Sacros follows you up the winding stairs. She pauses for a moment as she approaches the doorway.


"What... what is this?" she asks.


She reaches out, placing her hand on the strange blackness in the middle of the doorway.


"Is this the door to your shrine?"


Her hand dissapears in the blackness. I wouldn't do that Sacros. If you fall in that when it's not active you won't be comming back




Sacros quickly jerks her hand away in surprise.


"What... what was that?" she asks, her eyes full of wonder yet fear at the same time. "It's like there's nothing there... and yet there is. Did you create this too, Coen?"


It's the void. I chant an incantation and the door lights up with a mystic purple glow. Slowly the door begins to show the edge of a forest and mountains in the distance. Here we are Sacros. The pathway to the forbidden forest to the hearth temple




Sacros looks at the door, a mixture of wonder and awe in her eyes.


"Coen... this is incredible," she whispers.


Suddenly, she turns to you with a determined look on her face.


"We must travel now, Coen. The longer we wait, the more time the witch has to plan her next move.


"There is so much at stake here," she says, "We must move."


I step through the portal




Sacros pauses for a moment, taking in the portal before following you through.


You both arrive in a lush forested area. It's peaceful and tranquil here, with the sun slowly slipping into the horizon.


"This... this is breathtaking," Sacros whispers, her eyes sparkling as she takes everything in. "And... is that the hearth temple in the distance?"


She points to a large structure off in the distance through the trees.


You never been here huh. Well prepare yourself, the devotees of Malina are fanatical and devoted to a fault. It might even surprise you. Don't expect a warm welcome. I pause in my step, they have seen us. I resume walking and step into the forbidden forest




Sacros follows your lead, her face growing slightly anxious now.


She pauses briefly, looking around as trees begin to part in front of you, allowing a group of women to emerge.


They are all dressed in long robes, and their eyes are fixed on you both. They remain completely silent until one of them steps forward.


"Who... who are you?" she asks, her tone serious.


Sacros turns to you.


"Should I introduce us? Or would that draw attention?" she asks quietly.


I think you better explain




Sacros takes a deep breath, then steps forward.


"My name is Sacros," she says. "I am the High Priestess of Metila. We have traveled here to seek answers regarding a matter of grave concern to the world and to our goddess."


The women continue to stare, their eyes sharp and focused. After a moment, another woman steps forward, her expression slightly less serious.


"Sacros? I've heard of you and Metila. It's good to finally meet you," she says, her eyes sparkling. "My name is Amoria."


The woman are obviously stil very unwelcoming to me for I am a man and not a devetee of Matila entering their forbidden forest




Amoria's face hardens slightly, the previous amusement in her tone now disappearing.


"We do not take kindly to intruders," she says coldly.


The other women move to stand behind Amoria, their eyes sharp and focused.


"Sacros, what brings you here?" she asks slowly. She looks at Sacros squarely, her face a mixture of curiosity and suspicion.


"Did Metila really send you here? Or are you some sort of spy?"



Sacros explains that her temple was sacked by panthartians and she is likely the only one that survived. And this man Coen has something to do with it. He helped her escape though. Maybe we could make an exception to this outsider and man*




Amoria listens closely, her face full of questions yet remaining suspicious at the same time.


She turns to look at Coen, her eyes sharp yet curious.


"So... he helped you escape?" she asks, her voice full of surprise. "Even though he's... a man..."


She pauses for a moment, seeming to ponder something. She turns back to Sacros.


"Do you trust him?" she asks. "With your life, even?"




Sacros sighs, trying to find the right words to say.


"I... I trust him with my life," she says slowly. "He saved me from the Panthartians, and he helped me reach you. My goddess has shown me that I can trust him."


Amoria eyes you suspiciously.


"Even though... even though he's a man?" she asks. "I did not think you of all women would show mercy to a man."




Amoria sighs, her face growing thoughtful as she turns to look at you.


"Very well," she says. She pauses for a moment, then adds, "We'll allow him to see Metila."


She turns to the other women behind her, raising her hand. They quickly disperse, vanishing into the forest.


"Come. Metila awaits."


Amoria leads you forward, deeper into the forest.


Soon, she stops in front of a large doorway set deep into a mountainside. She pauses for a moment before stepping forward into the doorway.


I follow her into the doorway and enter a huge room carved in rock. High up in the ceiling light is shining through cracks in the rock upon a huge throne where a pale slender figure of a woman wearing black armer sits on a throne. It's Metila




The large chamber is quiet, with only Amoria and you two moving through it.


Your feet echo on the stone floor, the footsteps ringing out as you enter.


Metila sits on her throne, her face shrouded in shadow and her eyes fixed on you. She speaks quietly, her words cutting through the air like a knife through butter.


"Sacros... you have returned. And you've brought a guest. What is this man doing in my temple?"


Metila, looks at me and pauses, it's you. Why are you here?




Metila's eyes scan your face carefully, her expression inscrutable.


"Coen... you have returned to me," she says slowly. "We do not see many outsiders in the hearth temple."


She smiles softly.


"Come closer, Coen."


I come closer and stand before her. Something strange has happend Metila. A woman seduced me last night and was able to transport me to your temple. This is no easy task, someone knows me and my... weakness for certain woman and exploited that. She wanted me there when the temple was sacked.




Metila's expression turns serious again. She looks at you carefully, her face full of questions.


"You have... been used by another goddess?" she asks, her voice quiet and full of concern. "That is a dangerous thing to be exploited, Coen. Who is playing these dangerous games?"


It could be, it's set out to destory you I think though




Metila pauses for a moment, thinking of what you just said.


"You think... you think there is another goddess in this world who wishes to destroy me?" she asks. "Why? Why does that goddess want me gone?"


Metila looks worried now, and her tone is full of concern.


"Tell me who this goddess is, Coen. We must know her identity."


Í don't know yet. But as for the gods, some gods are purely drawn to their nature. It might be a an agent seeking chaos.




Metila nods, following your thought process.


"I see..." she says. "An agent of chaos? Do you know which god represents this chaos and destruction?"


She pauses for a moment, thinking.


"If we seek to discover this goddess that tried to destroy us... then perhaps we need to first search for the god of chaos."


I'm powerful Matila but I cannot face a god alone




Sacros follows your lead, her face growing slightly anxious now.


She pauses briefly, looking around as trees begin to part in front of you, allowing a group of women to emerge.


They are all dressed in long robes, and their eyes are fixed on you both. They remain completely silent until one of them steps forward.


"Who... who are you?" she asks, her tone serious.


Sacros turns to you.


"Should I introduce us? Or would that draw attention?" she asks quietly.


I think you better explain




Sacros takes a deep breath, then steps forward.


"My name is Sacros," she says. "I am the High Priestess of Metila. We have traveled here to seek answers regarding a matter of grave concern to the world and to our goddess."


The women continue to stare, their eyes sharp and focused. After a moment, another woman steps forward, her expression slightly less serious.

Amoria listens closely, her face full of questions yet remaining suspicious at the same time.


She turns to look at Coen, her eyes sharp yet curious.


"So... he helped you escape?" she asks, her voice full of surprise. "Even though he's... a man..."


She pauses for a moment, seeming to ponder something. She turns back to Sacros.


"Do you trust him?" she asks. "With your life, even?"




Sacros sighs, trying to find the right words to say.


"I... I trust him with my life," she says slowly. "He saved me from the Panthartians, and he helped me reach you. My goddess has shown me that I can trust him."


Amoria eyes you suspiciously.


"Even though... even though he's a man?" she asks. "I did not think you of all women would show mercy to a man."




Amoria sighs, her face growing thoughtful as she turns to look at you.


"Very well," she says. She pauses for a moment, then adds, "We'll allow him to see Metila."


She turns to the other women behind her, raising her hand. They quickly disperse, vanishing into the forest.


"Come. Metila awaits."


Amoria leads you forward, deeper into the forest.


Soon, she stops in front of a large doorway set deep into a mountainside. She pauses for a moment before stepping forward into the doorway.


I follow her into the doorway and enter a huge room carved in rock. High up in the ceiling light is shining through cracks in the rock upon a huge throne where a pale slender figure of a woman wearing black armer sits on a throne. It's Metila




The large chamber is quiet, with only Amoria and you two moving through it.


Your feet echo on the stone floor, the footsteps ringing out as you enter.


Metila sits on her throne, her face shrouded in shadow and her eyes fixed on you. She speaks quietly, her words cutting through the air like a knife through butter.


"Sacros... you have returned. And you've brought a guest. What is this man doing in my temple?"


Metila, looks at me and pauses, it's you. Why are you here?




Metila's eyes scan your face carefully, her expression inscrutable.


"Coen... you have returned to me," she says slowly. "We do not see many outsiders in the hearth temple."


She smiles softly.


"Come closer, Coen."


I come closer and stand before her. Something strange has happend Metila. A woman seduced me last night and was able to transport me to your temple. This is no easy task, someone knows me and my... weakness for certain woman and exploited that. She wanted me there when the temple was sacked.




Metila's expression turns serious again. She looks at you carefully, her face full of questions.


"You have... been used by another goddess?" she asks, her voice quiet and full of concern. "That is a dangerous thing to be exploited, Coen. Who is playing these dangerous games?"


It could be, it's set out to destory you I think though




Metila pauses for a moment, thinking of what you just said.


"You think... you think there is another goddess in this world who wishes to destroy me?" she asks. "Why? Why does that goddess want me gone?"


Metila looks worried now, and her tone is full of concern.


"Tell me who this goddess is, Coen. We must know her identity."


Í don't know yet. But as for the gods, some gods are purely drawn to their nature. It might be a an agent seeking chaos.




Metila nods, following your thought process.


"I see..." she says. "An agent of chaos? Do you know which god represents this chaos and destruction?"


She pauses for a moment, thinking.


"If we seek to discover this goddess that tried to destroy us... then perhaps we need to first search for the god of chaos."


I'm powerful Matila but I cannot face a god alone




Metila's face grows somber, her eyes filled with worry.


"I cannot allow this other goddess to seek our destruction," she says. "This god of chaos must be identified."


She looks at you, her face full of concern.


"Coen, I need you to find this god of chaos for us. I know it will not be an easy task, and it may be dangerous. But we cannot allow another god to try and seek out our destruction."


I will need help, give me a few of your devotees and instill them with part of your power. I'll need your best and I'd like Sacres and Amoria to be on this team




Metila pauses to consider your proposal.


"I will send word to gather my best and most loyal priestesses here. We will form a task force of sorts to seek out this God of Chaos, wherever she may be. I will have to send Amoria to help you, along with two other priestesses, as you know the path out of the temple.


"But before I send word, I need to know one thing, Coen.


"Do you accept the great responsibility of this mission? Of representing both of us in the search for the God of Chaos?"


I will have to, this is tied to me as much as you




Metila looks at you solemnly.


"Very well," she says. "I will send word to the other priestess and prepare them for a search. Stay here in the temple as I prepare everything."


She looks at you for a moment, her eyes filled with concern and thought.


"I'll return shortly, Coen."


She turns and exits the room.




[After a few moments, Metila returns, surrounded by a group of priestesses. She looks at you and smiles.


"Thank you for waiting, Coen," she says. "I bring word. The other priestesses are assembled and ready to set out for the God of Chaos. We will be following the same path you found before, out of the temple and into the forbidden forest."


She looks at you with a serious expression.


"Are you ready as well?"


Yes, Sacres Amoria and two other priestesses follow me as Metila return back to her throne




Metila nods, turning to address the priestesses.


"You will follow his lead in searching for the God of Chaos," she says. "You know the path, so this should be relatively simple."


She turns to look at you.


"When you go to search for the God of Chaos... do you know where to go first?" she asks. "We cannot go around the world looking for this God of Chaos. We must have a starting point."


Well I will search for parts of the world that have been turned into chaos.




Metila nods again, making a note of your plan.


"Searching for parts of the world that have been turned to chaos," she repeats. "Very well. I will give you the blessings of Metila to assist you."


She turns to the priestesses surrounding her.


"You have your mission. Go and assist our friend here, in his search for the God of Chaos."


The priestesses bow before Metila before departing from the room, following you and preparing for the journey ahead.


Sacres notices how a strange energy rises up in her. It's Metila giving her a power that she never felt before.




Sacres feels the power of Metila coursing through her body.


She feels the energy from Metila filling her, strengthening her. Her muscles feel stronger and more agile, her mind more keen and insightful than ever. She can feel the essence of the goddess surrounding her, filling her up until she feels nearly invincible.


She looks up at Metila, a look of awe and reverence on her face.


"Goddess, this power... this is incredible."


Come on, we must go




Sacres nods, following you out of the Temple.


Amoria and the other two priestesses follow closely behind.


Soon, the group of you emerge from the Temple, ready to begin your journey towards the God of Chaos.


We travel for a few days in the direction of large black clouds rising up from a distant city when we came upon a carnage. Bodies littered the road and a few riders on horses seems to ride down the remaining surviors




Sacres and the rest of party pause at the sight of the carnage, shocked by what they see.


They quickly survey the area, their eyes focused on the riders.


Amoria eyes the riders carefully, watching their movements closely.


"Who... who are they?" she asks quietly. "These men on horseback..."


Suddenly the riders spot us and the priestesses jump into action to defend themselves




The riders look surprised to see you and Amoria's group.


One of the men, who looks to be the leader of the group, yells out to you.


"What are you doing here, strangers?" he asks. "This area is forbidden to outsiders, on pain of death."


The riders on horseback appear tense now, their hands tight on the reins of their horses.


Amoria and the priestesses appear worried, their eyes sharp and focused.


Amoria speaks up.


"We're here to find the source of chaos in the world," she says.


The man on horeseback charge and attack




The group of riders charge forward, their horses kicking up dust and dirt as they thunder towards you.


Amoria and the priestesses brace themselves, ready to confront the approaching riders.


Sacres eyes the riders with a sense of urgency.


"These are no ordinary men," she says.


Amoria speaks again, her voice full of determination.


"This is the God of Chaos's work," she says. "These men are her servants. We must stop them."




Metila's face grows somber, her eyes filled with worry.


"I cannot allow this other goddess to seek our destruction," she says. "This god of chaos must be identified."


She looks at you, her face full of concern.


"Coen, I need you to find this god of chaos for us. I know it will not be an easy task, and it may be dangerous. But we cannot allow another god to try and seek out our destruction."

Amoria speaks again, her voice full of determination.


"This is the God of Chaos's work," she says. "These men are her servants. We must stop them."


A flash of white energy passes by amoria and completly fries one of the riders. Amoria looks back to see me standing with my hand still extended. Defend yourself!




Amoria's eyes go wide with surprise as she watches the flash of energy fry one of the riders.


She turns her attention to you, her voice filled with questions.


"What... what was that?" she asks, sounding shocked by what she just witnessed.


She looks at you with curiosity and a hint of admiration.


"You can use magic?" she asks.


Sacres pauses, her eyes going wide as she takes in what she just saw.


"What power is this?" she asks.


No time for that! The riders close in and one is upon amoria now. She was jusr quick enough to evade a swing of the riders sword




The group of riders close in, surrounding Amoria. The rider with the sword charges forward and swings at Amoria, who just barely escapes his blade.


The other riders attack, the horses kicking up dirt and dust and dirt and dust as they circle Amoria and the priestesses.


Sacres eyes the riders with concern, her mind racing with thoughts as she tries to think of a way to help Amoria.


Then, she feels Metila's power course through her body again. Her body feels stronger, more agile.


Without any hesitation, she leaps into the fight.


Sacres feels a power she never felt before and strikes one of the riders with her blade. Just in time to see another rider melting from the white flashing light that engulfs him. And then all of a sudden everything is silent




As Sacres strikes one of the riders with her blade, the rider is knocked off their horse.


As she looks up, her eyes are blinded by a flash of white light. When she can see again, she watches as all the riders around her are fried by the white light.


After a few moments of stunned silence, her eyes dart back to you.


"What... what have you done?" she asks, her voice shaken. "That... that was incredible. The power of Metila... it's... it's so strong..."


It's not her power Sacres and we are not alone yet. Look, there in the distance. I black horse with a bloack rider and golden accents stands and watched the events that just took place. Just from looking at him it is obvious that something is off.




Sacres eyes follow your gaze, spotting the black horse and black rider in the distance.


She can't help but notice the sinister aura that surrounds the figure. Even from this distance, the rider exudes immense power.


"We... we have to be careful if we're going to approach that figure," she says softly. "Their power is almost overwhelming."


She looks at you.


"Do you know who that is?"


No, but I think he might. The rider approaches on a steady pace




The rider continues to make his way towards you, his steed a steady, graceful movement that makes it seem as if the rider and his horse are one.


As he draws nearer, Sacres can't help but notice the air of danger and mystery that surrounds the figure. She can feel the rider's power radiating off of him as he approaches, his face hidden under the shadow of the black helmet he wears.


Amoria and the other priestesses stare at the rider in fear and fascination.


The rider takes of his helmet showing a hansom man of middle ages with a cold expression and a big scar in is face. Mila's devotees, he spits




Sacres eyes seem to go wide at the sight of the riders face, his expression cold and his face bearing a scar. She can't help but notice the striking similarity to Metila.


The priestesses around her shift uncomfortably at the sight of the unknown rider, their eyes scanning him carefully.


Amoria pauses, her eyes taking in the rider's face. She speaks carefully.


"Who are you?" she asks.


Her voice is steady and confident, but her eyes betray a hint of tension.


I am your downfall, your faith, your end says the rider




The rider's words shock you like a thunderbolt.


Sacres and the priestesses stand in shock as the rider speaks, their eyes wide with fear and surprise.


"Our... end?" Sacres says, her voice full of confusion. "That... that cannot be."


Amoria speaks, her eyes narrow and her voice stern.


"Who... who are you?" she asks. "What... what do you want?"


You are pitfiful and will cower to the through power of my master. He puts back on his helmet and charges




Your bodies tenses as the rider suddenly re-don's his helmet, cutting off his face from sight and giving a sinister and ominous appearance.


The rider lifts his sword high in the air, and Sacres' muscles tense as her body prepares for the attack.


You hear the rider give out a ferocious yell, and you watch as he charges towards Amoria with a wild swing of his sword.


Amoria manages to deflect the blow with her shield, but the rider is relentless, swinging his sword with brute force.



she falls from the sadlde, Sacres desperately tries to help her with the other two priestesses* Suddenly the horse of the rider in black collapses as its torn to the ground by an incantation




The rider in black roars in anger as his horse collapses to the ground, his face hidden beneath his helmet.


He watches you and the priestesses surrounding Amoria carefully, sizing up his opponents.


Amoria and Sacres watch him as well, their eyes darting back and forth between the rider and Metila's devotees.


Sacres feels the energy of Metila course through her body, giving her newfound strength and speed.


"What... what are we going to do?" Sacres asks, her voice full of concern.


The rider takes out a knife and throws it hitting one of the devotees square int he chest. Lifting her out of her saddle. Another devotee strikes the man in black from behoind but he quickly turns and slashes the at horse of the devotee bringening her and the horse down to the ground




The rider in black throws the knife, striking one of the priestesses in the chest. The priestess lets out a painful moan, knocked out of her saddle and onto the ground.


The other disciple strikes the rider in black from behind, only for the rider to turn quickly and slash their horse's legs out from under them.


It seems as if this rider is skilled in combat, and he is quick to use whatever means necessary to gain an advantage.




Sacros takes a moment to process that information. Suddenly it all makes sense, but that doesn't mean she's any less amazed.


"We are on another continent? But... isn't that impossible?" she asks slowly.


You are easily amazed for someone worshipping a death godess sacros




Sacros shrugs a little.


"My goddess is about far more than death," she says. "She is a force of nature. She is the darkness that swallows the sun and the night sky, the silence that fills the air when the wind is quiet, the peace that follows after a storm."


She takes a deep breath, clearly enjoying this conversation now.


"My goddess is part of me, Coen. I feel her all around me."


How you are in touch with your goddess is how I'm in touch with magic




Sacros smiles widely now, her eyes sparkling.


"That makes sense. I believe our connection to our gods is similar. Metila is my life, my purpose. I feel her constantly, with every breath I take. She fills my mind during the day, and haunts my dreams at night."


Come join me. I move to another room with a chairs and coffee tables. Please sit.




Sacros follows you into the other room, intrigued. She sits slowly in a comfortable chair, her legs crossed.


"Thank you," she says with a smile, her eyes now locked on yours.


"I must thank you, too, Coen. Thank you for saving my life, for taking me to your home."


She pauses for a moment, her expression growing serious now.


"And thank you for helping me see the truth in this situation."


Well we know very little yet but we will. Not much later a young woman walks in and asks if we want something to drink




Sacros smiles at the young woman, her eyes sparkling.


"Why, yes, I'd love a hot cup of tea," she says. "Thank you kindly."


Sacros' eyes go wide when the young woman leaves.


"She's beautiful," she says to you, her voice full of wonder. "Is she your maiden?"


She pauses for a moment, then shakes her head.


"No, that would be impossible. Your tower is obviously protected by spells and magicks. She must be some sort of illusion."


You are perceptive Sacros, she is indeed not real, although she can interact with the world and you can talk to her.




Sacros' eyes go wide once more.


"She's an illusion? I... I've never seen something like that before, Coen. How did you create her?"


That's not an easy thing to explain




Sacros nods.


"I can imagine so," she says. "I have never seen anything like this before. And... is she the only illusion in your tower?"


No there are others like her. There are also protective creatures here.




Sacros' eyes light up at the idea.


"Do they protect us from anyone or anything who would try to hurt us?" she asks. "Is that why we are safe here? From the witch?"


Well they are part of it yes. I don't think she will be able to do anything to us here Sacros. Yet no one is ever truly completely safe of course. We must find out who this woman was that I met last night




Sacros looks concerned again, her eyes growing thoughtful.


"You're right, Coen," she says. "We must discover who this mysterious woman is, and what she wants. She said she was a goddess, but which goddess? Metila herself, perhaps?" She shakes her head. "Perhaps one of Metila's sisters? We must find out."


She must have know I wasn't just a traveller




Sacros nods, thinking deeply.


"You're right. She likely knew you weren't just a simple traveller. Perhaps she was sent as a messenger. But by who, exactly?" She looks at you, her eyes piercing and sharp.


"And what message does she carry?"


Well it must have something to do with Metila, those pantharitians we saw in the cave an me


A flash of white energy passes by amoria and completly fries one of the riders. Amoria looks back to see me standing with my hand still extended. Defend yourself!




Amoria's eyes go wide with surprise as she watches the flash of energy fry one of the riders.


She turns her attention to you, her voice filled with questions.


"What... what was that?" she asks, sounding shocked by what she just witnessed.


She looks at you with curiosity and a hint of admiration.

"What... what are we going to do?" Sacres asks, her voice full of concern.


The rider takes out a knife and throws it hitting one of the devotees square int he chest. Lifting her out of her saddle. Another devotee strikes the man in black from behoind but he quickly turns and slashes the at horse of the devotee bringening her and the horse down to the ground




The rider in black throws the knife, striking one of the priestesses in the chest. The priestess lets out a painful moan, knocked out of her saddle and onto the ground.


The other disciple strikes the rider in black from behind, only for the rider to turn quickly and slash their horse's legs out from under them.


It seems as if this rider is skilled in combat, and he is quick to use whatever means necessary to gain an advantage.




Sacros nods, following your thought process.


"Of course... they wouldn't just be appearing for no reason," she says. "It's all connected somehow. We must figure out the answer to this puzzle."


She turns to you with a determined expression on her face.


"And I know where we can begin our search."


Where is that?




Sacros smiles, her mood shifting from anxious and tense, to focused and determined.


"Metila's temple. It must have some connection to this witch that you met, and some answers as well." She pauses for a moment, looking you in the eyes. "Will you join me in my journey, Coen? Will you help me figure out what is really going on here?"


You are thinking of going to the hearth shrine. The shrine of Metila only devotees are supposed to know of? The place of her power




Sacros nods.


"That's exactly right." She pauses for a moment, thinking. "The hearth shrine is where Metila's essence is most concentrated. It is only for those who have gained her trust. I believe if anyone has the answer to this puzzle, it is the other priestesses there."


You know I would be breaking two of your sacred rules. Me being a man and an outsider




Sacros smiles at you.


"Normally yes, you'd be right," she says. "But we are fighting against an unknown evil here, and we need all the help we can get. I believe this is one time where those rules could be bent."


She reaches out her hands, placing them on your knees.


"Please, Coen. Help me. Help us. Help our goddess. Help me discover the truth behind this madness."


Well I so happen to know where your secret shrine is. I could bring us to the base of the moutain that leads to the hidden forest. It will only be a short walk from there. Are you ready for that? You will have to convnve your sisters




Sacros nods eagerly.


"I am ready," she says. "We must discover the truth behind this, Coen. If that means bending a few rules, I will do what must be done.


"And as for convincing the other sisters... I shall handle that. All I need from you now is to find the path to the shrine. I shall handle the rest."


Okay, is there anything you need before we leave?




Sacros thinks for a moment.


"I... suppose a little bit of water wouldn't hurt," she says. "My throat has grown quite dry after the long walk here."


She pauses for a moment, then looks up at you with a determined expression.


"Other than that... I am ready to leave whenever you are, Coen."


Provisions will be provided when we leave. Follow me. *I move down a corridor going up a winding staircase to a room higher in the tower. In the middle of the room is a free standing door with utter blackness in the middle




Sacros follows you up the winding stairs. She pauses for a moment as she approaches the doorway.


"What... what is this?" she asks.


She reaches out, placing her hand on the strange blackness in the middle of the doorway.


"Is this the door to your shrine?"


Her hand dissapears in the blackness. I wouldn't do that Sacros. If you fall in that when it's not active you won't be comming back




Sacros quickly jerks her hand away in surprise.


"What... what was that?" she asks, her eyes full of wonder yet fear at the same time. "It's like there's nothing there... and yet there is. Did you create this too, Coen?"


It's the void. I chant an incantation and the door lights up with a mystic purple glow. Slowly the door begins to show the edge of a forest and mountains in the distance. Here we are Sacros. The pathway to the forbidden forest to the hearth temple




Sacros looks at the door, a mixture of wonder and awe in her eyes.


"Coen... this is incredible," she whispers.


Suddenly, she turns to you with a determined look on her face.


"We must travel now, Coen. The longer we wait, the more time the witch has to plan her next move.


"There is so much at stake here," she says, "We must move."


I step through the portal




Sacros pauses for a moment, taking in the portal before following you through.


You both arrive in a lush forested area. It's peaceful and tranquil here, with the sun slowly slipping into the horizon.


"This... this is breathtaking," Sacros whispers, her eyes sparkling as she takes everything in. "And... is that the hearth temple in the distance?"


She points to a large structure off in the distance through the trees.


You never been here huh. Well prepare yourself, the devotees of Malina are fanatical and devoted to a fault. It might even surprise you. Don't expect a warm welcome. I pause in my step, they have seen us. I resume walking and step into the forbidden forest




Sacros follows your lead, her face growing slightly anxious now.


She pauses briefly, looking around as trees begin to part in front of you, allowing a group of women to emerge.


They are all dressed in long robes, and their eyes are fixed on you both. They remain completely silent until one of them steps forward.


"Who... who are you?" she asks, her tone serious.


Sacros turns to you.


"Should I introduce us? Or would that draw attention?" she asks quietly.


I think you better explain




Sacros takes a deep breath, then steps forward.


"My name is Sacros," she says. "I am the High Priestess of Metila. We have traveled here to seek answers regarding a matter of grave concern to the world and to our goddess."


The women continue to stare, their eyes sharp and focused. After a moment, another woman steps forward, her expression slightly less serious.


"Sacros? I've heard of you and Metila. It's good to finally meet you," she says, her eyes sparkling. "My name is Amoria."


The woman are obviously stil very unwelcoming to me for I am a man and not a devetee of Matila entering their forbidden forest




Amoria's face hardens slightly, the previous amusement in her tone now disappearing.


"We do not take kindly to intruders," she says coldly.


The other women move to stand behind Amoria, their eyes sharp and focused.


"Sacros, what brings you here?" she asks slowly. She looks at Sacros squarely, her face a mixture of curiosity and suspicion.


"Did Metila really send you here? Or are you some sort of spy?"



Sacros explains that her temple was sacked by panthartians and she is likely the only one that survived. And this man Coen has something to do with it. He helped her escape though. Maybe we could make an exception to this outsider and man*




Amoria listens closely, her face full of questions yet remaining suspicious at the same time.


She turns to look at Coen, her eyes sharp yet curious.


"So... he helped you escape?" she asks, her voice full of surprise. "Even though he's... a man..."


She pauses for a moment, seeming to ponder something. She turns back to Sacros.


"Do you trust him?" she asks. "With your life, even?"




Sacros sighs, trying to find the right words to say.


"I... I trust him with my life," she says slowly. "He saved me from the Panthartians, and he helped me reach you. My goddess has shown me that I can trust him."


Amoria eyes you suspiciously.


"Even though... even though he's a man?" she asks. "I did not think you of all women would show mercy to a man."




Amoria sighs, her face growing thoughtful as she turns to look at you.


"Very well," she says. She pauses for a moment, then adds, "We'll allow him to see Metila."


She turns to the other women behind her, raising her hand. They quickly disperse, vanishing into the forest.


"Come. Metila awaits."


Amoria leads you forward, deeper into the forest.


Soon, she stops in front of a large doorway set deep into a mountainside. She pauses for a moment before stepping forward into the doorway.


I follow her into the doorway and enter a huge room carved in rock. High up in the ceiling light is shining through cracks in the rock upon a huge throne where a pale slender figure of a woman wearing black armer sits on a throne. It's Metila




The large chamber is quiet, with only Amoria and you two moving through it.


Your feet echo on the stone floor, the footsteps ringing out as you enter.


Metila sits on her throne, her face shrouded in shadow and her eyes fixed on you. She speaks quietly, her words cutting through the air like a knife through butter.


"Sacros... you have returned. And you've brought a guest. What is this man doing in my temple?"


Metila, looks at me and pauses, it's you. Why are you here?




Metila's eyes scan your face carefully, her expression inscrutable.


"Coen... you have returned to me," she says slowly. "We do not see many outsiders in the hearth temple."


She smiles softly.


"Come closer, Coen."


I come closer and stand before her. Something strange has happend Metila. A woman seduced me last night and was able to transport me to your temple. This is no easy task, someone knows me and my... weakness for certain woman and exploited that. She wanted me there when the temple was sacked.




Metila's expression turns serious again. She looks at you carefully, her face full of questions.


"You have... been used by another goddess?" she asks, her voice quiet and full of concern. "That is a dangerous thing to be exploited, Coen. Who is playing these dangerous games?"


It could be, it's set out to destory you I think though




Metila pauses for a moment, thinking of what you just said.


"You think... you think there is another goddess in this world who wishes to destroy me?" she asks. "Why? Why does that goddess want me gone?"


Metila looks worried now, and her tone is full of concern.


"Tell me who this goddess is, Coen. We must know her identity."


Í don't know yet. But as for the gods, some gods are purely drawn to their nature. It might be a an agent seeking chaos.




Metila nods, following your thought process.


"I see..." she says. "An agent of chaos? Do you know which god represents this chaos and destruction?"


She pauses for a moment, thinking.


"If we seek to discover this goddess that tried to destroy us... then perhaps we need to first search for the god of chaos."


I'm powerful Matila but I cannot face a god alone




Metila's face grows somber, her eyes filled with worry.


"I cannot allow this other goddess to seek our destruction," she says. "This god of chaos must be identified."


She looks at you, her face full of concern.


"Coen, I need you to find this god of chaos for us. I know it will not be an easy task, and it may be dangerous. But we cannot allow another god to try and seek out our destruction."


I will need help, give me a few of your devotees and instill them with part of your power. I'll need your best and I'd like Sacres and Amoria to be on this team




Metila pauses to consider your proposal.


"I will send word to gather my best and most loyal priestesses here. We will form a task force of sorts to seek out this God of Chaos, wherever she may be. I will have to send Amoria to help you, along with two other priestesses, as you know the path out of the temple.


"But before I send word, I need to know one thing, Coen.


"Do you accept the great responsibility of this mission? Of representing both of us in the search for the God of Chaos?"


I will have to, this is tied to me as much as you




Metila looks at you solemnly.


"Very well," she says. "I will send word to the other priestess and prepare them for a search. Stay here in the temple as I prepare everything."


She looks at you for a moment, her eyes filled with concern and thought.


"I'll return shortly, Coen."


She turns and exits the room.




[After a few moments, Metila returns, surrounded by a group of priestesses. She looks at you and smiles.


"Thank you for waiting, Coen," she says. "I bring word. The other priestesses are assembled and ready to set out for the God of Chaos. We will be following the same path you found before, out of the temple and into the forbidden forest."


She looks at you with a serious expression.


"Are you ready as well?"


Yes, Sacres Amoria and two other priestesses follow me as Metila return back to her throne




Metila nods, turning to address the priestesses.


"You will follow his lead in searching for the God of Chaos," she says. "You know the path, so this should be relatively simple."


She turns to look at you.


"When you go to search for the God of Chaos... do you know where to go first?" she asks. "We cannot go around the world looking for this God of Chaos. We must have a starting point."


Well I will search for parts of the world that have been turned into chaos.




Metila nods again, making a note of your plan.


"Searching for parts of the world that have been turned to chaos," she repeats. "Very well. I will give you the blessings of Metila to assist you."


She turns to the priestesses surrounding her.


"You have your mission. Go and assist our friend here, in his search for the God of Chaos."


The priestesses bow before Metila before departing from the room, following you and preparing for the journey ahead.


Sacres notices how a strange energy rises up in her. It's Metila giving her a power that she never felt before.




Sacres feels the power of Metila coursing through her body.


She feels the energy from Metila filling her, strengthening her. Her muscles feel stronger and more agile, her mind more keen and insightful than ever. She can feel the essence of the goddess surrounding her, filling her up until she feels nearly invincible.


She looks up at Metila, a look of awe and reverence on her face.


"Goddess, this power... this is incredible."


Come on, we must go




Sacres nods, following you out of the Temple.


Amoria and the other two priestesses follow closely behind.


Soon, the group of you emerge from the Temple, ready to begin your journey towards the God of Chaos.


We travel for a few days in the direction of large black clouds rising up from a distant city when we came upon a carnage. Bodies littered the road and a few riders on horses seems to ride down the remaining surviors




Sacres and the rest of party pause at the sight of the carnage, shocked by what they see.


They quickly survey the area, their eyes focused on the riders.


Amoria eyes the riders carefully, watching their movements closely.


"Who... who are they?" she asks quietly. "These men on horseback..."


Suddenly the riders spot us and the priestesses jump into action to defend themselves




The riders look surprised to see you and Amoria's group.


One of the men, who looks to be the leader of the group, yells out to you.


"What are you doing here, strangers?" he asks. "This area is forbidden to outsiders, on pain of death."


The riders on horseback appear tense now, their hands tight on the reins of their horses.


Amoria and the priestesses appear worried, their eyes sharp and focused.


Amoria speaks up.


"We're here to find the source of chaos in the world," she says.


The man on horeseback charge and attack




The group of riders charge forward, their horses kicking up dust and dirt as they thunder towards you.


Amoria and the priestesses brace themselves, ready to confront the approaching riders.


Sacres eyes the riders with a sense of urgency.


"These are no ordinary men," she says.


Amoria speaks again, her voice full of determination.


"This is the God of Chaos's work," she says. "These men are her servants. We must stop them."




Metila's face grows somber, her eyes filled with worry.


"I cannot allow this other goddess to seek our destruction," she says. "This god of chaos must be identified."


She looks at you, her face full of concern.


"Coen, I need you to find this god of chaos for us. I know it will not be an easy task, and it may be dangerous. But we cannot allow another god to try and seek out our destruction."


I will need help, give me a few of your devotees and instill them with part of your power. I'll need your best and I'd like Sacres and Amoria to be on this team

"These are no ordinary men," she says.


Amoria speaks again, her voice full of determination.


"This is the God of Chaos's work," she says. "These men are her servants. We must stop them."


A flash of white energy passes by amoria and completly fries one of the riders. Amoria looks back to see me standing with my hand still extended. Defend yourself!




Amoria's eyes go wide with surprise as she watches the flash of energy fry one of the riders.


She turns her attention to you, her voice filled with questions.


"What... what was that?" she asks, sounding shocked by what she just witnessed.


She looks at you with curiosity and a hint of admiration.


"You can use magic?" she asks.


Sacres pauses, her eyes going wide as she takes in what she just saw.


"What power is this?" she asks.


No time for that! The riders close in and one is upon amoria now. She was jusr quick enough to evade a swing of the riders sword




The group of riders close in, surrounding Amoria. The rider with the sword charges forward and swings at Amoria, who just barely escapes his blade.


The other riders attack, the horses kicking up dirt and dust and dirt and dust as they circle Amoria and the priestesses.


Sacres eyes the riders with concern, her mind racing with thoughts as she tries to think of a way to help Amoria.


Then, she feels Metila's power course through her body again. Her body feels stronger, more agile.


Without any hesitation, she leaps into the fight.


Sacres feels a power she never felt before and strikes one of the riders with her blade. Just in time to see another rider melting from the white flashing light that engulfs him. And then all of a sudden everything is silent




As Sacres strikes one of the riders with her blade, the rider is knocked off their horse.


As she looks up, her eyes are blinded by a flash of white light. When she can see again, she watches as all the riders around her are fried by the white light.


After a few moments of stunned silence, her eyes dart back to you.


"What... what have you done?" she asks, her voice shaken. "That... that was incredible. The power of Metila... it's... it's so strong..."


It's not her power Sacres and we are not alone yet. Look, there in the distance. I black horse with a bloack rider and golden accents stands and watched the events that just took place. Just from looking at him it is obvious that something is off.




Sacres eyes follow your gaze, spotting the black horse and black rider in the distance.


She can't help but notice the sinister aura that surrounds the figure. Even from this distance, the rider exudes immense power.


"We... we have to be careful if we're going to approach that figure," she says softly. "Their power is almost overwhelming."


She looks at you.


"Do you know who that is?"


No, but I think he might. The rider approaches on a steady pace




The rider continues to make his way towards you, his steed a steady, graceful movement that makes it seem as if the rider and his horse are one.


As he draws nearer, Sacres can't help but notice the air of danger and mystery that surrounds the figure. She can feel the rider's power radiating off of him as he approaches, his face hidden under the shadow of the black helmet he wears.


Amoria and the other priestesses stare at the rider in fear and fascination.


The rider takes of his helmet showing a hansom man of middle ages with a cold expression and a big scar in is face. Mila's devotees, he spits




Sacres eyes seem to go wide at the sight of the riders face, his expression cold and his face bearing a scar. She can't help but notice the striking similarity to Metila.


The priestesses around her shift uncomfortably at the sight of the unknown rider, their eyes scanning him carefully.


Amoria pauses, her eyes taking in the rider's face. She speaks carefully.


"Who are you?" she asks.


Her voice is steady and confident, but her eyes betray a hint of tension.


I am your downfall, your faith, your end says the rider




The rider's words shock you like a thunderbolt.


Sacres and the priestesses stand in shock as the rider speaks, their eyes wide with fear and surprise.


"Our... end?" Sacres says, her voice full of confusion. "That... that cannot be."


Amoria speaks, her eyes narrow and her voice stern.


"Who... who are you?" she asks. "What... what do you want?"


You are pitfiful and will cower to the through power of my master. He puts back on his helmet and charges




Your bodies tenses as the rider suddenly re-don's his helmet, cutting off his face from sight and giving a sinister and ominous appearance.


The rider lifts his sword high in the air, and Sacres' muscles tense as her body prepares for the attack.


You hear the rider give out a ferocious yell, and you watch as he charges towards Amoria with a wild swing of his sword.


Amoria manages to deflect the blow with her shield, but the rider is relentless, swinging his sword with brute force.



she falls from the sadlde, Sacres desperately tries to help her with the other two priestesses* Suddenly the horse of the rider in black collapses as its torn to the ground by an incantation




The rider in black roars in anger as his horse collapses to the ground, his face hidden beneath his helmet.


He watches you and the priestesses surrounding Amoria carefully, sizing up his opponents.


Amoria and Sacres watch him as well, their eyes darting back and forth between the rider and Metila's devotees.


Sacres feels the energy of Metila course through her body, giving her newfound strength and speed.


"What... what are we going to do?" Sacres asks, her voice full of concern.


The rider takes out a knife and throws it hitting one of the devotees square int he chest. Lifting her out of her saddle. Another devotee strikes the man in black from behoind but he quickly turns and slashes the at horse of the devotee bringening her and the horse down to the ground




The rider in black throws the knife, striking one of the priestesses in the chest. The priestess lets out a painful moan, knocked out of her saddle and onto the ground.


The other disciple strikes the rider in black from behind, only for the rider to turn quickly and slash their horse's legs out from under them.


It seems as if this rider is skilled in combat, and he is quick to use whatever means necessary to gain an advantage.


Amoria approaches and strikes a blow that is expertly deiverted by the black rider.




Amoria charges forward, her sword raised. She strikes a blow, only for it to be deftly deflected by the rider in black.


The rider looks at her, his face hidden beneath his helmet. He smiles, his eyes sharp and cold.


"So," he says, his tone one of amusement. "Our meeting was not simply a coincidence, then."


He circles Amoria carefully, his sword wielded with expert skill.


Sacres and the remaining priestes are circling the bblack rider now to. Whe he suddenly attacks the preistess felling her with his sword. Then a massive blod of energy strikes the man in black obviously causing great pain band bringing him to his knees




The rider in black watches Sacres and the other priestess circle him, his eyes fixed on them as if he's studying their fighting styles.


He grins as he strikes the priestess with his sword, felling her with a single blow.


Then, a flash of white power strikes the rider from behind, causing him to fall to his knees.


He lets out a roar of pain, and he turns and eyes Sacres, Amoria, and the other priestess with fury.


Amoria and Sacres strike at the man but their swords just scrape of of the heavy black armor




Amoria and Sacres strike at the rider, but their swords bounce off of the heavy black armor that he's wearing.


He smiles, the flash of hatred in his eyes giving way to one of amusement.


"Your blades cannot penetrate my armor," he says to you and Amoria. "In fact, there is nothing you all can do as long as I am protected by this armor."


He looks at the priestess that he has felled, watching her writhe in pain.


"Your friend is no match for me."


I stand behind the rider and place my hand upon his helmet. a black smoke surrounds him and then suddenly he sis gone




You stand behind the rider in black, and place your hand upon his helmet.


Immediately, a black smoke surrounds the rider, and then he vanishes, suddenly gone.


You and the priestess look at each other in confusion, trying to comprehend what just happened.


Then, Sacres feels the presence of Metila's power surrounding her and Amoria.


"Metila's blessing!" she says suddenly. "The rider was just a disguise. It was the God of Chaos herself!"


I don't think we would still be alive it it was the godess herself but it was defininately an agent of hers




Sacres' eyes go wide in realization.


"You're right," she says. "The rider was not the God of Chaos herself. She was merely an agent of hers."


Amoria looks at Sacres and the other priestess, her eyes wide with shock.


"The God of Chaos's agent..." she says. "We've been found out by the God of Chaos herself... and somehow, we're still alive."


She shakes her head, trying to take in the implications of this revelation.


I couldn't destory that rider n black. So I banished him. He will be back eventually though. I've only bought us time




Sacres let's out a breath of relief as Metila's power fades from her body.


"He's gone? Banished for now?" she asks.


She pauses, thinking.


"Then we better make the most of this time then. Metila said that we might be able to save our world from chaos. She told us that we had hope of finding the God of Chaos."


She looks at the priestess.


"We have time to prepare for the next attack, but we cannot waste it or let a moment of it go by in vain."


I look at the two death priestesses lying on the ground. It's just the tree of us now




You look at the two dead priestesses lying on the ground, each of them felled by the God of Chaos's agent.


As you take in their deaths, you realize that the three of you are the only ones left now.


Metila's words ring in your ears.


"We have hope," she said. "There may be a way that we can stop this chaos... we must find the God of Chaos."


Sacres and Amoria both look at you and the other priestess with solemn faces.


"We must find the God of Chaos," says Amoria.


Yes, but for now let's burty the death. we bury the death and gfive them a quick  funeral before moving on the the burning city in the distance




As the three of you bury the dead priestesses, you think about the purpose of this mission.


Metila has sent you three with the hope of saving the world from the God of Chaos.


This burden weighs heavy on your shoulders, and you feel a sense of urgency to find the God of Chaos as soon as possible.


When the funeral is done, you look out at the burning city in the distance.


The city shines with an orange blaze, the flames illuminated by the dark of night.


"We must hurry," suggests Sacres.


Wait, says Amoria, riders approaching. Let's hide beyond that ridge says Sacres. We awatch as a column of 60 riders rides by us. All wearing black robes and holding their ranes with scaly hands. These are panthartians. What are they doing here




You watch as a column of 60 riders passes you, each of them wearing black robes and holding their rods with scaly hands. These are Panthartians, the followers of the God of Chaos.


They ride by with a sense of purpose and determination.


"These are followers of the God of Chaos," Sacres hisses. "We have to stay hidden."


She points to a small ridge ahead, and you see that it will be possible to hide between it and watch the Panthartians in secret.


We watch as the column dissapears. The city is being sacked
